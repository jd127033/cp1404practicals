# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

They were typically accurate, however some tasks did take a bit more time to complete. Larger tasks were harder to estimate
therefore were less accurate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Once I had used the estimates a few times, I got pretty good a guessing how long a task would take. My estimate accuracy did
improve over the course.


### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Time management. It helped me plan my study and ensured that I completed the assigned tasks on time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learnt to be able to take constructive criticism and apply it to my future projects. I also showed me that people can
bring fresh ideas to already 'completed' code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing code reviews for people made me really reflect on my own code and the expectations that this class has in regards to style
and patterns. It also taught how to provide constructive criticism and helped me with identifying errors.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Week 7 Practical Review](https://github.com/elijahwalkerrr/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-21060985153)

### Explanation

This code review was good because I commented on a variety of points. I made comments on spacing, taught patterns,
appropriate use of functions, docstrings, naming and task output matching. I also mentioned use of constants, formatting
and code conciseness. I also made sure to make positive comments so that the student would know what they were doing well.
It was a well rounded review.

### Good Code Review 2

[Week 8 Practical Review](https://github.com/jd130067/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-3497894419)

### Explanation

I believe this code review was good as I provided feedback on the good and the bad. I commented on layout which was minor
though it can make a difference. I also was stringent on the docstrings as I believe that they are very important.
I also made sure to let the student know what they were doing well at to help guide their learning.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Reduce the quantity or length of each one.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did well in completing what was asked of me by reading the instructions carefully. I also enjoyed the code reviews
and believe I did quite well with them also.
